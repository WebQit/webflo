CHTML is a suite of new DOM features that brings native support for modern UI development paradigms: a component-based architecture, data binding, and reactivity. This lets us build elegant user interfaces using the web platform itself.

> CHTML is being proposed as a [W3C standard at the Web Platform Incubator Community Group](https://discourse.wicg.io/t/proposal-oohtml/4716) based on [this explainer](https://github.com/web-native/oohtml/blob/master/explainer.md).
